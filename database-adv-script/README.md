# SQL Advanced Joins — Airbnb Database

## Description

This file contains complex SQL join queries written as part of the ALX Airbnb database project. The goal is to practice and demonstrate understanding of different types of joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.

## Queries

### 1️⃣ INNER JOIN

- Retrieves all bookings along with the user details who made those bookings.
- Only returns records where there is a matching user for each booking.

### 2️⃣ LEFT JOIN

- Retrieves all properties along with their reviews.
- Includes properties that do not have any reviews (review columns will show as NULL).

### 3️⃣ FULL OUTER JOIN

- Retrieves all users and all bookings.
- Includes users without bookings and bookings not linked to a user.
